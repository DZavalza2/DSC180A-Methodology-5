**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
From my experience, I think the most interesting topic that I covered was when we were looking at how disease prevalence changes based on age groups. While it seems like a simple idea, we first had to categorize them into age groups and see their prevalance then use K-means clustering to find out which diseases were more proninent in younger subgroups compared to older subgroups, the diseases which are more prevelant in older subgroups compared to younger subgroups and which diseases had a generally low prevelance throughout all age subgroups.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I think a potential investigation that we could do is create a new scoring metric using machine learning that can accuratly predict wether a patient is suspectable of having sepsis. As of right now, there is 6 differnet scoring metrics to see a patients risk but none of them (execpt one) use the patients actual background which we are starting to notice may lead to them developing sepsis. Once we find a new scoring metric or model, we can test it using the current data and show how doctors can use this to better assist patients. This can be created in an application where doctors and input patients medical records and symtoms and they can get alerts on if there is a strong chance of the patient developing different diseases, specifically sepsis. 

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One change I would make would be for our team to focus less on replicating exactly and rather looking at replicating the same idea. For example, we spent weeks trying to replicate the exact number of patients in each group to the study however, the database has since been updated so this was near impossible. Plus, even if we did get the same number of patients in each group there was so many different techniques  used that I wouldn't be surprised if we over complciated it to match exactly that we got the correct number of patients but ordered or categorized wrong. In other words, I would focus more on the main idea or main goal of replciating the idea but wouldn't fight over obtain the exact same numbers, as long as I'm seeing the same trend.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Given more time, I think being able to produce a fully usable website or application would be nice but given that we only have 10 week, there is no way an application to detect possible sepsis would be possible. Other than that, I think we are good as of now with the tools that we have.
